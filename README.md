# Klaudia Matysiak - 1st Milestone Project - Wedding Photography Portfolio

My 1st Milestone Project is website designed for a non-existing photographer named Krystine Monté based in Cardiff. I always wanted to be a wedding photographer, so this project is my vision of how my website would look like. I would like the page to be in the perception of a wedding as a magical dream. It's designed to be responsive at all devices.

## Design

![Palette](documentation/images/palette.png)

I decided to choose simple layout of main color Misty Rose, with accent of Pale Pink, and to contrast main background color is white, and general text color is Davys Grey. In my opinion those colors match perfect for the wedding portfolio.

## Wireframes
I created wireframes in the balsamiq program as first visual concept of the website.

* Desktop Wireframe - Full PDF file with desktop wireframes you can find [here](documentation/files/desktop-wedding-portfolio.pdf)

![Desktop Wireframe](documentation/images/desktop-wireframe.png)

* Desktop Wireframe - Full PDF file with desktop wireframes you can find [here](documentation/files/mobile-wedding-portfolio.pdf)

![Desktop Wireframe](documentation/images/mobile-wireframe.png)

## Updates from original wireframes
* Congratulations and What's next section - I decided to expand congratulations to make a bond with potential client. What's next section I made more visable for the user.
* Icon link that takes user to the end of page - I added it on the page to make sure that user is not missing whole content of the home page.
* Gallery - I've changed layout of the gallery for a modern view, with 4 columns at desktop view, 2 columns at tablet view, and 1 column at mobile view. I add fancybox to the gallery as suggested my mentor.
* About section - I decided to change places of image with text.
* Contact Page - I decided to add a photo and kind words for the user before contact form. I made vertical form to look like a piece of paper. I added one input "What package are you interested in?" to the form. I changed input type to checkbox for "How did you find me?".
* On the mobile view I changed logo position from centre to the left side and elements in the footer are centered. 

# Features
## Navigation Bar
* The navigation bar style is consistent. It will navigate user through the website. Main bar includes links to the Home, About and Contact page, while hovering on the Wedding it shows submenu which includes link to the Portfolio, Packages & Prices and Reviews page. For the screen of maximum size 960 pixels element of the menu will shrink font size from 28 px to 20 px and for the mobile screen of maximum size 480 pixels navbar will change for the humberger menu on the right and logo on the left.
