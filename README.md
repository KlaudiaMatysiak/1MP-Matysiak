# Klaudia Matysiak - 1 Milestone Project - Wedding Photography Portfolio

My 1 Milestone Project is website designed for a non-existing photographer named Krystine Monté based in Cardiff. I always wanted to be a wedding photographer, so this project is my vision of how my website would look like. I would like the page to be in the perception of a wedding as a magical dream. It's designed to be responsive at all devices.

## Design

![Palette](documentation/images/palette.png)

I decided to choose simple layout of main color Misty Rose, with accent of Pale Pink, and to contrast main background color is white, and general text color is Davys Grey. In my opinion those colors match perfect for the wedding portfolio.

## Wireframes
I created wireframes in the balsamiq program as first visual concept of the website.
